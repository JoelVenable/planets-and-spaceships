# Practice: Planet and Spaceships

## Setup

```
mkdir -p ~/workspace/csharp/exercises/lists && cd $_
dotnet new console
```

## Instructions

In the `Main` method, place the following code

```cs
List<string> planetList = new List<string>(){"Mercury", "Mars"};
```

1. `Add()` Jupiter and Saturn at the end of the list.
1. Create another `List` that contains that last two planet of our solar system.
1. Combine the two lists by using `AddRange()`.
1. Use `Insert()` to add Earth, and Venus in the correct order.
1. Use `Add()` again to add Pluto to the end of the list.
1. Now that all the planets are in the list, slice the list using `GetRange()` in order to extract the rocky planets into a new list called `rockyPlanets`. The rocky planets will remain in the original planets list.
1. Being good amateur astronomers, we know that Pluto is now a dwarf planet, so use the `Remove()` method to eliminate it from the end of `planetList`.
